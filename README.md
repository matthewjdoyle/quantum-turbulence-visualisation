## Plans

### Code

- Relational imports for python files (no more hardcoded file urls or adding paths)

- Update all code to latest versions and ensure working

- Add python-environment building files (to ensure all required packages are installed via pip)

- Refactor codebase

- Analysis of improved tracking

- ***Would be nice to have:***

    - Dashboard to view analysis charts (Python/Django or HTML/CSS)
